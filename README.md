# Data Cleaning Projects

A repository showcasing SQL data cleaning techniques, primarily using PostgreSQL.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects designed for practicing data cleaning techniques using SQL, specifically in PostgreSQL. Each project aims to tackle common data quality issues encountered in real-world datasets. These projects were inspired by a post from Sushanta Khara on LinkedIn, which highlighted the importance of clean data for effective analysis.

Ensuring data quality is crucial in any data analysis process. Dirty or inconsistent data can lead to inaccurate or misleading insights. This repository focuses on transforming “dirty” data into reliable, structured datasets that can support sound decision-making and analysis.

#### Problem Statement

In data analysis, data must be clean and well-structured before meaningful insights can be drawn. Poor data quality often results in unreliable, inaccurate, and misleading outcomes. Key steps in the data cleaning process include:

1. **Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records**: Ensuring unique entries in the dataset.
2. **Trimming Extra Spaces and Removing Invalid Characters**: Cleaning text data to standardize values.
3. **Splitting or Combining Fields as Needed**: Adjusting columns for the dataset’s requirements.
4. **Validating Field Ranges**: Ensuring that values like age or dates fall within expected ranges.
5. **Identifying and Addressing Outliers**: Recognizing unusual data points that could impact analysis.
6. **Standardizing Misspellings or Incorrect Entries**: Maintaining consistency in naming conventions and entries.
7. **Adding Relevant Calculated Fields**: Creating new columns to enhance data insights.
8. **Handling Null and Missing Values**: Replacing or removing incomplete data as appropriate.

Following these guidelines, the goal is to create a clean and structured SQL table ready for analysis.

## Datasets Used

This repository contains a range of datasets, each chosen to illustrate and practice different SQL techniques for data cleaning. Key SQL concepts covered include:

- **Core SQL Queries**: Using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to query data.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Employing `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` to generate summary statistics.
- **Join Operations**: Utilizing `INNER`, `OUTER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` joins to merge datasets.
- **CTEs, Temporary Tables, and Views**: Organizing complex queries and improving query readability.
- **String and Date Manipulation Functions**: Formatting and parsing text and date fields.
- **Window Functions**: Applying `RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and `NTILE` to analyze data trends and ranks.

Each project provides hands-on practice with these techniques, primarily using PostgreSQL, to enhance your SQL skills in data cleaning and preparation.
